# Initium-Maze-Guide
A small javascript script to make walking through mazes easy.
# Installation
To use, install tampermonkey or greasemonkey for whatever browser you're in. Then, create a new userscript and copy in the contents of Initium-Maze-Guide.js
# Usage
It will relabel all of the path routes in a maze, for easy movement. Note that you need to have the path avaible first.
To use, just press the "Reset Maze Paths" button on the top left of the screen. You need to press this every time you move to a new location in the maze. 

Enjoy!
